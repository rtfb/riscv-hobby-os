// "The real-time clock (RTC) is located in the always-on domain, and is clocked
// by a selectable low-frequency clock source. For best accuracy, the RTC should
// be driven by an external 32.768 kHz watch crystal oscillator, but to reduce
// system cost, can be driven by a factorytrimmed on-chip oscillator."
